Sage Homework 2

The function factor takes an integer n and prints its factors to the screen.
I also wrote another function, NewFactor, that returns a list of factors.
This one is not recursive, but still ends up slower than the first.

For example, NewFactor(1227184536156238675) yields [5, 5, 29, 1289, 347443, 3779509L]
and factor(1227184536156238675) prints
5
5
29
1289
347443
3779509
